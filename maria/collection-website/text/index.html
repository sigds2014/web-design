          <h1>Inspiration</h1>
          <p>Every vacation I remember, for as long as I remember, all of my friends headed to the sunny coast while my parents and I embarked on travels indoors, to the art museums. I have visited all the capitols of Europe, and while my friends basked in the sunshine, I strolled down the long galleries of Louvre, El Prado, Uffizi Gallery, you name it. Back then these places and the precious works they contained meant very little to me as I failed to understand the historical and cultural wealth before me. Why can’t we just take pictures, buy souvenirs, taste traditions, and move on? Not too long ago, however, I have started to comprehend just how large a role art plays in truly exploring and experiencing a country.</p>
          <p>So, here is where Tour Thru Art comes in as a brief guide to show us just how vividly a country’s personality can be reflected in and "thru" its art.</p>
