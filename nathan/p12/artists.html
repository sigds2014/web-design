                    <h6>Who inspires you?</h6>
                        <p>Herb Lubalin, Paul Rand, Charley Harper, WeBuyYourKids, Doublenaut, Young
                        Monster, Raymond Biesinger, Sonnenzimmer, Silent Giants, cats, metal bands, girls with pretty eyes.</p>
                    <h6>What is your typical process?</h6>
                        <p>I like to let ideas incubate for a few weeks... Not even put a pen to a piece of
                        paper until I’ve mulled over my thoughts for a healthy amount of time. After
                        that I like to start sketching out composition and small elements. Following
                        the sketching is a lot of back and forth between pen drawings, scanning, redrawing
                        in Illustrator, printing off and fucking up with copiers and lacquer
                        thinner and other junk, and rescanning. Nothing is ever made entirely in
                        the computer. Eventually I’m left a thick pile of trash and paper and a fairly
                        organized digital file.</p>
                    <h6>Any advice for newbies?</h6>
                        <p>Work hard. Work until you feel like dying and then work a bit more. No one
                        can motivate you more than yourself.</p>
                    <h6>Do you have any design education?</h6>
                        <p>Bachelors Degree in Fine Arts - Visual Communication and Design from the
                        University of Nebraska at Kearney. Graduated in 2007.</p>
                    <h6>Favourite part of poster design?</h6>
                        <p>My favorite part is the forced restriction and economy of colors. In most
                        digital arts and design applications, the designer is free to use however many
                        hundreds of colors that they wish, but in screen printing, the designer is
                        forced to be constantly aware of color. I feel like it forces the designer to be
                        much more clever and intelligent.</p>
                    <h6>Your favourite piece of design equipment?</h6>
                        <p>I have a couple of old 1970s/1980s photocopiers that I love. Epic trashiness.
                        That being said, I couldn’t live without my scanner. It’s just a run of the mill
                        large format Epson, but I use it dozens and dozens of times every single day.
                    <h6>Your most used piece of design equipment?</h6>
                        <p>See above. Scanner.</p>
                    <h6>What do you think makes a good poster?</h6>
                        <p>I think a good poster is like a good song. There is no checklist of points that
                        it must achieve or not set rules that it must follow. You instantly know a
                        good poster the second you see it. A good poster sits at an intersection of
                        uniqueness, solid implementation and production, and fun.</p>
                    <h6>Do you do any other design work? If so, what?</h6>
                        <p>I love to handle any sort of illustration or physical/print design that is thrown
                        at me. While I have an obvious love for creating tangible objects (vinyl records,
                        tshirts, snowboards, beer packaging, etc etc etc), I have been working much
                        more on pure illustration work. I’d love to get more into editorial illustration.</p>
                    <h6>Can you describe your studio/workspace to me?</h6>
                        <p>It’s a small 500-600 square foot one room studio in a beautiful historic
                        building that was originally a grocery wholesaler. It’s a pretty typical mix of
                        contemporary furniture and devices coupled with vintage decoration and
                        rough walls and floors that you will find in many design studios. The highlight
                        of our studio is definitely the faux darkroom we built in the back corner
                        using nothing but recycled wood, culled from sources as diverse as hundred
                        year old shipping crates to barn wood to the sides of pinball tables.</p>
                    <h6>What’s the best thing about your studio?</h6>
                        <p>The best thing is the sense of freedom and experimentation. Every time I
                        want into the studio, I feel the strange sensation that I get to do whatever I
                        want. True, there is shit I SHOULD do each day, but no one is actually going
                        to tell me to do it. If I want to blow off all responsibilities for the day and
                        draw a psychedelic dragon, it’s totally within my grasp.</p>
                    <h6>What is the worst thing about running your own studio?</h6>
                        <p>The ups and downs of owning a business are much greater than just being
                        a part of a business. When things go well, you feel like you can take on the
                        world, but when shit goes wrong, you feel the sting far worse.</p>
                    <h6>Can you give any background info on your design history?</h6>
                        <p>Doe Eyed was originally started in 2007 or so as a name for my afterhours
                        freelance work, which typically was music/band related. The amount of music
                        work kept increasing and getting cooler and cooler, with bigger and bigger
                        bands and projects. Eventually in 2011, I decided it was time to cut ties
                        with the traditional advertising/design world and strike out after Doe Eyed
                        fulltime. Around that time, we decided to add my previous screen-printing
                        partner and art show co-curator as a part of Doe Eyed name. Where things
                        go from here, we have no idea.</p>

                   <h6>Who inspires you?</h6>
                        <p>I am inspired the most by my peers in the poster community. Whenever
                        someone puts out something amazing, we all take notice.</p>
                    <h6>What is your typical process?</h6>
                        <p>I don’t have a typical process. I prefer drawing most of the time, versus using the computer.</p>
                    <h6>Do you have any illustration education?</h6>
                        <p>I have a Bachelor’s of Fine Art in Illustration from California State University Long Beach.</p>
                    <h6>Your most used piece of illustration equipment?</h6>
                        <p>Everything ultimately ends up on the computer to prepare it for screen
                        printing. So I guess the computer, my Wacom tablet, and Adobe CS are the
                        most used illustration equipment around here.</p>
                    <h6>What do you think makes a good poster?</h6>
                        <p>If the poster clearly communicates an idea, then it’s a good poster in my
                        opinion. Then again, a good poster doesn’t always equal good illustration.
                    <h6>Do you do any other illustration work? If so, what?</h6>
                        <p>I’ve done all kinds of illustration work. That would include apparel, book,
                        editorial, toy, web, and probably some other stuff. For me, illustration is
                        illustration. The application could be for anything if the idea and execution
                        are good.</p>
                    <h6>Can you give any background info on your illustration history?</h6>
                        <p>Let’s see... I started working as an illustrator while I was a student at California State University. I had worked as a doll accessory designer (I know, I know,laugh it up. I was young and I needed the work!). During my final semester I started writing and illustrating a children’s book that got published. In 2005, I finished school.</p>
                        <p>After school, I did various freelance illustration work like t-shirt designs (i.e. I won a competition for Threadless.com) and editorials (X-Box Magazine,
                        LA Weekly). That was kind of rough, because I was spending as much, if not
                        more time, looking for work than I was working. This period of my life lasted
                        for about a year.</p>
                        <p>The most regular work I could find that suited me was toy and children’s
                        illustration. I began working as an in-house illustrator for various toy
                        companies. The work I did ranged from designing toys, concepts, packaging,
                        instruction sheets, etc. That kind of work was extremely educational. I learned
                        many computer skills from some of the best in their field. Those skills would
                        later help me with posters.</p>
                        <p>In 2007, while I was employed at a major toy company, I did my first poster
                        for a band. Poster after poster followed and the work was so fun, I left my job
                        and just did posters for bands. Those posters led to other illustration work
                        and high profile projects like movie posters and such.
                        That just about covers my six year fling with illustration.</p>

                    <h6>What is your typical process?</h6>
                        <p>I try to immerse myself in music and lyrics before I begin any design gig. I come up with a concept through written word, then I begin the thumbnail process. I scour the library, antique stores, and the like for design elements, then it is on to Photoshop and Illustrator to flesh out my design concept.</p>

                        <p>Give yourself the best chance in this field by working for a large company before you freelance or start your own company.

                        <p>A good poster communicates a message instantly and evokes emotion. A good poster can also be as simple as anything that is aesthetically pleasing and looks beautiful hanging on a wall. GOOD TYPOGRAPHY.</p>

                        much more clever and intelligent.</p>
                    <h6>Your favourite piece of design equipment?</h6>
                        <p>I have a couple of old 1970s/1980s photocopiers that I love. Epic trashiness.
                        That being said, I couldn’t live without my scanner. It’s just a run of the mill
                        large format Epson, but I use it dozens and dozens of times every single day.
                    <h6>Your most used piece of design equipment?</h6>
                        <p>See above. Scanner.</p>
                    <h6>What do you think makes a good poster?</h6>
                        <p>I think a good poster is like a good song. There is no checklist of points that
                        it must achieve or not set rules that it must follow. You instantly know a
                        good poster the second you see it. A good poster sits at an intersection of
                        uniqueness, solid implementation and production, and fun.</p>
                    <h6>Do you do any other design work? If so, what?</h6>
                        <p>I love to handle any sort of illustration or physical/print design that is thrown
                        at me. While I have an obvious love for creating tangible objects (vinyl records,
                        tshirts, snowboards, beer packaging, etc etc etc), I have been working much
                        more on pure illustration work. I’d love to get more into editorial illustration.</p>
                    <h6>Can you describe your studio/workspace to me?</h6>
                        <p>It’s a small 500-600 square foot one room studio in a beautiful historic
                        building that was originally a grocery wholesaler. It’s a pretty typical mix of
                        contemporary furniture and devices coupled with vintage decoration and
                        rough walls and floors that you will find in many design studios. The highlight
                        of our studio is definitely the faux darkroom we built in the back corner
                        using nothing but recycled wood, culled from sources as diverse as hundred
                        year old shipping crates to barn wood to the sides of pinball tables.</p>
                    <h6>What’s the best thing about your studio?</h6>
                        <p>The best thing is the sense of freedom and experimentation. Every time I
                        want into the studio, I feel the strange sensation that I get to do whatever I
                        want. True, there is shit I SHOULD do each day, but no one is actually going
                        to tell me to do it. If I want to blow off all responsibilities for the day and
                        draw a psychedelic dragon, it’s totally within my grasp.</p>
                    <h6>What is the worst thing about running your own studio?</h6>
                        <p>The ups and downs of owning a business are much greater than just being
                        a part of a business. When things go well, you feel like you can take on the
                        world, but when shit goes wrong, you feel the sting far worse.</p>
                    <h6>Can you give any background info on your design history?</h6>
                        <p>Doe Eyed was originally started in 2007 or so as a name for my afterhours
                        freelance work, which typically was music/band related. The amount of music
                        work kept increasing and getting cooler and cooler, with bigger and bigger
                        bands and projects. Eventually in 2011, I decided it was time to cut ties
                        with the traditional advertising/design world and strike out after Doe Eyed
                        fulltime. Around that time, we decided to add my previous screen-printing
                        partner and art show co-curator as a part of Doe Eyed name. Where things
                        go from here, we have no idea.</p>
