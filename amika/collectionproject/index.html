            <h4>What is Colony Collapse Disorder?</h4>
            

            <p>Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a phenomenon where worker honey bees abruptly vanish from their colony. While such disappearances have occurred 
            throughout history, the syndrome was named “colony collapse disorder” in 2006 after an 
            astonishing  rise in numbers of dissappearances of the Western honeybee colonies in the United States.
            While CCD is drastically affecting honeybee populations in the States, the phenomenon is a global issue with reported cases in Europe and Asia.
            </p> 

            <p>Colony collapse is significant to the global economy as many of the world’s agricultural crops are pollinated by the European honey bees. In 2005, reports from the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the net worth of global crops pollinated by honeybee’s was estimated to be approximately $200 billion. The causes of CCD and its prevalence remains unclear, however many ideas have been proposed.</p>

        <h4>The Prevalence of Colony Collapse Disorder in the United States</h4>

        <p> In 2008, the National Agriculture Statistics Service reported that there were 2.44 million honey-producing hives in the United States in contrast to 4.5 million in 1980 and 5.9 million in 1947. While these numbers underestimate the total number of managed hives as they exclude several thousand hives managed for pollination contracts only, and also do not include hives managed by beekeepers owning fewer than 5 hives. The under-representation may be offset through the practice of some hives being counted in more than one state.Hives moved to different state to produce honey are counted in each state's total and summed in the total counts. </p>

        <p> In 2007, at least 24 states and portions of Canada reported at least one case of CCD. Concurrently, a survey of 384 responding beekeepers from 13 states, 23.8% me the specified criterion for CCD (at least 50% of their dead colonies were found without bees and/or with very few dead bees in the hive or apiary). From 2006-2007, beekeepers with CCD-suffering operations had total losses at 45% compared to 25% of all colonies experienced by non-CCD afflicted beekeepers. </p>

        <p> A 2007–2008 survey of over 19% of all colonies revealed a total loss of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, the same number of colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations were more likely to have this symptom suggesting that a contagious condition may be a causal factor. Sixty percent of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, and thus possibly suffered from CCD. </p>

        <p>In 2010, the USDA reported that data on overall honey bee losses for the year indicate an estimated 34% loss, which is statistically similar to losses reported in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In 2011, the loss was 30%. In 2012–2013, CCD was blamed for the loss of about half of the US honeybee hives, far more than the 33% losses observed on average over previous years. </p>

        <h4>Consequences</h4>
        <p> The phenomenon of CCD is particularly important for crops such as almond, grown in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2006 was estimated at $1.5 billion. However, in 2000, the total U.S crop value that was wholly dependent upon honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion. </p>

        <p>Due to the fact the honey bees are not native to the Americas, their necessity is strictly limited to agricultural and ornamental uses, because no native plant life requires honey bee pollination; with the exception of monoculture situations–where the pollination need is so great during bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees. </p>

        <p> Honey bees are responsible for the pollination of approximately one third of the United States crop species. These crops include almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, and strawberries to name a few. Many, but not all of these plants, may be pollinated by other insects or bees, but not a a commerical scale. While farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring honey bees to help pollinate, none specidically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, it is assumed that the native pollinators will reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve that plant life (assuming that the plants naturally occur in that specific region). </p>

        <p> However, even though on a per-individual basis, many other species are actually more efficient at pollinating, with respect to the 30% of crop types where honey bees are utilized, most native pollinators may not be mass-utilized as easily or as effectively as honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Honey bees are advantageous because beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed. The bees will also visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore inherently linked to the prosperity of the beekeeping industry. </p>
